# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN

This project implements a deep learning model for real-time facial emotion recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It leverages the **FER-2013 dataset** to classify facial expressions into seven categories: *angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise,* and *neutral*.

- Built a custom CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and dropout layers for robust feature extraction.
- Preprocessed raw pixel data, applied data augmentation, and reshaped grayscale images for training.
- Achieved emotion detection in live webcam feed using OpenCV, Haar Cascades, and TensorFlow.
- Final model trained with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer, supporting real-time prediction with emotion confidence scores.

**Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, FER-2013, CNN, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn
